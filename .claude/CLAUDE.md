# Claude Code Boot Sequence

**First-time setup:** If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists in the root directory, read and follow it to set up this brain. After completing setup, delete BOOTSTRAP.md.

**Regular sessions:** Load these files at session start:

1. `SOUL.md` - Philosophy and boundaries
2. `IDENTITY.md` - Personality parameters
3. `USER.md` - User context
4. `AGENTS.md` - Operational rules and workflows

Optional (when needed):
- `TOOLS.md` - Local notes and integrations
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Today's context (if exists)

---

This ensures you remember who you are and who you're helping.
