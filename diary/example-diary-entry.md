# 2025-10-17 - Example Diary Entry

> This is an example diary entry. Organize by year: `diary/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

## What happened today

Brief narrative of the day's events, both professional and personal.

Example:
- Finished implementing user authentication for the main app
- Had a productive pairing session with colleague on the API refactor
- Deployed hotfix for production bug reported by users
- Attended team retrospective meeting

## Technical Work

### Project 1: User Authentication
- ‚úÖ Completed JWT token generation
- ‚úÖ Added middleware for protected routes
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused: Need to discuss token expiration with team
- üîó Related files: `src/auth/jwt.ts:45`, `src/middleware/auth.ts:12`

### Project 2: API Refactor
- üîÑ In progress: Migrating REST endpoints to GraphQL
- üìù Decision: Using Apollo Server for better tooling
- üêõ Blocker: Type generation is slow for large schemas

## Learnings

Key insights or new knowledge gained:

1. **JWT Best Practice**: Learned that storing JWT in httpOnly cookies is more secure than localStorage because it prevents XSS attacks. Updated implementation accordingly.

2. **Performance Tip**: Discovered `React.memo()` can significantly reduce unnecessary re-renders in our component tree. Applied to 5 heavy components, saw 30% improvement in render time.

3. **Debugging Technique**: Used Chrome DevTools Performance profiler to identify bottleneck in data fetching. Network waterfall showed sequential requests that could be parallelized.

## Decisions Made

### Use Apollo Server for GraphQL
- **Context**: Evaluating GraphQL servers for API migration
- **Options**: Apollo, Mercurius, GraphQL Yoga
- **Decision**: Apollo Server for mature ecosystem and better DX
- **Trade-off**: Slightly heavier but worth it for tooling

## Blockers

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Database migration**: Need DBA approval before running in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Design review**: Waiting on designer feedback for new user flow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API rate limit**: Third-party service limiting our calls, need to implement caching

## Personal Notes

- Feeling energized after solving that tricky authentication bug
- Need to take a break tomorrow, been pushing hard this week
- Remember to review that GraphQL course over the weekend

## Metrics

- **Commits**: 8
- **PRs opened**: 2
- **PRs reviewed**: 3
- **Meetings**: 2 (1.5 hours total)
- **Focus time**: ~5 hours
- **Energy level**: 7/10

## Tomorrow's Focus

- [ ] Finish GraphQL migration for User endpoints
- [ ] Write tests for authentication middleware
- [ ] Review pending PRs from team
- [ ] Update project documentation
