# Example Todo: Implement User Authentication

> This is an example todo file. Name your files: `YYYY-MM-DD-task-name.md`

## Context

Why this task needs to be done and what problem it solves.

Example: We need user authentication to secure the admin panel and allow personalized user experiences.

## Requirements

- [ ] Must support email/password login
- [ ] Optional OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Session management with JWT
- [ ] Remember me functionality

## Steps

- [ ] Research authentication libraries (Passport.js, Auth0, etc.)
- [ ] Design database schema for users table
- [ ] Implement registration endpoint
- [ ] Implement login endpoint
- [ ] Add password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] Create JWT token generation
- [ ] Add middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Write tests for auth endpoints
- [ ] Update frontend login/register forms

## Success Criteria

What "done" looks like:
- Users can register with email/password
- Users can login and receive JWT token
- Protected routes reject unauthenticated requests
- Password reset email workflow works
- All tests pass

## Resources

- [Passport.js Documentation](https://www.passportjs.org/)
- [JWT Best Practices](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
- Related brain notes: `brain/diary/2025/2025-10-15-auth-research.md`

## Notes

Any additional thoughts, blockers, or considerations:
- Consider rate limiting for login attempts
- Need to decide on token expiration time (1 hour? 7 days?)
- Should we support 2FA in v1 or defer to v2?

## Updates

### 2025-10-15
Started research on authentication libraries. Leaning toward Passport.js for flexibility.

### 2025-10-16
Blocked: Need to finalize database schema before proceeding with implementation.
